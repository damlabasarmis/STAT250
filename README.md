# STAT250
In this project, “Factors Affecting Happiness” have been analyzed using R. Observed variables from the
dataset are the Healthcare Index, Air Quality Index, Green Space Area, Cost of Living, and Traffic
Density. Research questions that were created to analyze the relationship between the Happiness Score
and variables are:

1. Is the average happiness score significantly different from the hypothesized value 5?
2. Is there a significant difference between the means of happiness scores of cities with high traffic
density and medium traffic density?
3. Do countries with air quality above %60 degrees have higher happiness rates?
4. Is there a significant difference in the proportion of cities with a high healthcare index between
cities with high green space area and low green space area?
5. How does Healthcare Index affect Happiness Score?
6. What Air Quality Index and Healthcare Index affect Happiness Score?
7. Do means of happiness scores differ depending on the healthcare index?

 Statistical methods that were used in this project are inferences about the mean, comparisons of
means, inferences about proportion, comparisons of proportion, one-way or two-way ANOVA and
multiple comparisons, and simple and multiple linear regression. After exploratory analysis, we have
decided on the correct statistical tests, checked the requirements and met the assumptions. Finally we
made inferences to our research questions from the test results.
